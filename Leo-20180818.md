## 1. Leetcode
[Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/description/)
> A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

> Return a deep copy of the list.
#### Analysis
Python 3 has a standard package for copying. `return copy.deepcopy(head)` is actually accepted by OJ, but it might not be good
enough in a real interview.

In order to deep copy the list, all nodes of the list and the linkages of the nodes should be copied.
It's an easy job to deep copy a regular linked list, but with the random pointer, the problem becomes interesting. 

My initial idea was doing two iterations: one to copy labels and next pointers, and another one to copy the random pointers.
However, it's hard to copy over a random pointer because without extra information, it's impossible to know
which node the random pointer points to in this newly created linked list. A workaround would be mirroring the linked list
with an array, so each node gets an index, and the next node or the random node it points to also gets an index. 

A similar idea would be mapping the old nodes to new nodes. Initially, the new nodes only have labels, but 
it's easy to construct the linkages with another iteration.  Below is an implementation of the idea.


#### Implementation
```python
class Solution(object):
    def copyRandomList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: RandomListNode
        :rtype: RandomListNode
        """
        if not head:
            return None
        
        nodes = {}
        # 1st iteration: map RandomListNode objs to newly created orphan nodes
        curr = head
        while curr:
            nodes[curr] = RandomListNode(curr.label)
            curr = curr.next
            
        # 2nd iteration: reconstruct the linkages among the orphan nodes
        curr = head
        while curr:
            if curr.next:
                nodes[curr].next = nodes[curr.next]
            if curr.random:
                nodes[curr].random = nodes[curr.random]
            curr = curr.next
            
        return nodes[head]
```

There is a similar problem to [clone(deep copy) a graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/). The idea is the same: map old graph nodes to new nodes, and reconstruct
the relations.

```python
class Solution:
    # @param node, a undirected graph node
    # @return a undirected graph node
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        if not node:
            return None
        
        # 1st iteration: map nodes from the original graph to newly created orphan nodes
        # DFS
        all_nodes = {}
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            curr_node = stack.pop()
            all_nodes[curr_node] = UndirectedGraphNode(curr_node.label)
            for nb in curr_node.neighbors:
                if nb not in all_nodes:
                    stack.append(nb)
        
        # 2nd iteration: reconstruct relations
        for old_node, new_node in all_nodes.items():
            for neighbor in old_node.neighbors:
                new_node.neighbors.append(all_nodes[neighbor])
        
        return all_nodes[node]
```

## 2. Article and comment
[Python: Shallow and deep copy operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy)

Source code: [Lib/copy.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.7/Lib/copy.py)

(below content excerpted from the lib documentation)

Assignment statements in Python do not copy objects, they create bindings between a target and an object. **For collections that are mutable or contain mutable items, a copy is sometimes needed so one can change one copy without changing the other.** This module provides generic shallow and deep copy operations.

The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or class instances):

- A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
- A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don’t exist with shallow copy operations:

- Recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly, contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop.
- Because deep copy copies everything it may copy too much, such as data which is intended to be shared between copies.

The deepcopy() function avoids these problems by:

- keeping a “memo” dictionary of objects already copied during the current copying pass; and
- letting user-defined classes override the copying operation or the set of components copied.
