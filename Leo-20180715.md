[Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/description/)

 > Implement a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) with insert, search, and startsWith methods.

####  Analysis

Essentially, an trie is a special kind of a tree.

There are many ways to represent an trie node. For example, we may use a 26-slots `list`, each slot for a character, assuming only lower-case strings will be stored. In each slot, we need to preserve information like whether the slot contains a value (Boolean) - if it does, whether it's the terminal character(e.g. "e" in "apple"); if not, we need an pointer pointing to the next node. A data structure for a single node would be `[[has_value, is_terminal, next_node] for _ in range(26)]`. It's quick to access a specific slot in a list, but we will end up wasting lots of memory cause we only use a small portion of the slots.

Another way is using `dict` or hash table to represent a node. In each node, we map characters to their next level nodes. Also, we need to know if a character terminates the string. In this way, we use memory only when it's necessary. Below is an implementation of this approach.

####  Implementation

```Python
class Trie:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        # a dict mappping char to its children which are tries themselves
        self.tries = {}  


    def insert(self, word):
        """
        Inserts a word into the trie.
        :type word: str
        :rtype: void
        """
        tries = self.tries
        for c in word:
            if c not in tries:
                tries[c] = {}
            tries = tries[c]
        tries['END'] = 'END'


    def search(self, word):
        """
        Returns if the word is in the trie.
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        tries = self.tries
        for c in word:
            if c not in tries:
                return False
            tries = tries[c]
        return 'END' in tries


    def startsWith(self, prefix):
        """
        Returns if there is any word in the trie that starts with the given prefix.
        :type prefix: str
        """
        tries = self.tries
        for c in prefix:
            if c not in tries:
                return False
            tries = tries[c]

        return True

# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Trie()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
```

 [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) - Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/solution/)

It's the official solution for the problem above. It provides some interesting uses of the trie structure. Also, it visualizes the problem and give some sample codes.
