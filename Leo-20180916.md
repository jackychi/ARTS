[Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/description/)

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

- The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
- You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

> Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcdefg", wordDict = ["abc", "de", "fg", "d", "efg]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "abcdefg" can be segmented as "abc de fg"
or "abc d efg".
```
> Example 2:
```python
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```
#### Analysis
The brute force solution would be breaking the input into parts and checking if every part can be 
found in wordDict. There are 2<sup>n</sup> ways to cut the input, the time complexity would be O(2<sup>n</sup>). -- See implementation 1 for the code

It's easy to see that there are lots of overlapped sub-problems. For example, s[i:j]
could be a sub-array of s[m:n] or s[x:y], so s[i:j] could be touched twice, which 
is a waste of time. Therefore, we can memorize the output of the sub-problems 
for future use(a.k.a. memoization).

#### Implementation
Solution 1: Brute Force
```python

class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s, wordDict):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type wordDict: List[str]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        wordDict = set(wordDict)
        def _helper(s):
            if s in wordDict:
                return True
            for i in range(len(s)):
            # seg s into two parts, return True if both parts are breakable
                if _helper(s[:i]) and _helper(s[i:]):
                    return True
            return False
        return _helper(s)

```
Solution 2: Recursion with memoization
```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s, wordDict):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type wordDict: List[str]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        wordDict = set(wordDict)
        memo = dict(zip(wordDict, [True]*len(wordDict)))
        def _helper(s):
            if s in memo:
                return memo[s]
            for i in range(len(s)):
                if _helper(s[:i]) and _helper(s[i:]):
                    memo[s] = True
                    return True
            memo[s] = False
            return False
        return _helper(s)
```
