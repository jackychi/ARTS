## 1. Leetcode
[Linked List Cycle - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

> Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.


#### Analysis
By storing the nodes that have been visited, which needs extra spaces, it's easy to determine if the list has a cycle in it or not.

The solution without using extra space is a little bit tricky: traverse the list with two pointers, one moves
slow, and the other one moves fast, so if the fast pointer catches the slow one, there must be a cycle. 

The implementation doesn't use extra space.

#### Implementation
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not head:
            return False
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while slow != fast:
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                return False
            slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next
        return True
```

## 2. Article and comment
[Udacity: Intro to DevOps](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud611)

A very lightweight introduction to DevOps:
1. CALMS: the DevOps lifecycle
2. Packer: Solve the problem of development-production environment discrepancy by building automated machine images.
3. Jenkins:  Continuous Integration tool

The course only touches the surface of DevOps. Also, the Packer template for building Jenkins server
is broken.

## 3. New skill/tool
[Packer by HashiCorps](https://www.packer.io/)
> Packer is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.

> Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant, creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel. Packer does not replace configuration management like Chef or Puppet. In fact, when building images, Packer is able to use tools like Chef or Puppet to install software onto the image.

> A machine image is a single static unit that contains a pre-configured operating system and installed software which is used to quickly create new running machines. Machine image formats change for each platform. Some examples include AMIs for EC2, VMDK/VMX files for VMware, OVF exports for VirtualBox, etc.
