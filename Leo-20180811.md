## 1. Leetcode
[Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/description/)

#### Analysis
The difference between [Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/description/) and [Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/description/) is for III the path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, 
which creates a lot of possibilities.

A brute-force way is using the method that solves II to check all the subtrees and return the accumulated count.
It would be a nested recursion, which has the O(N<sup>2</sup>) time complexity. 

There is actually an O(N) dynamic programming solution which solve the problem in O(N) time. I am still trying to
figure out the details (TODO).

#### Implementation
```python
# Brute force
class Solution(object):
    cnt = 0
    def pathSum(self, root, sum):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type sum: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # helper function to find the  valid paths that extends from root to its children
        def preorder(node, curr_sum):
            if node:
                curr_sum += node.val
                if curr_sum == sum:
                    self.cnt += 1
                preorder(node.left, curr_sum)
                preorder(node.right, curr_sum)
                
        # check root and left/right child
        preorder(root, 0)
        if root:
            self.pathSum(root.left, sum)
            self.pathSum(root.right, sum)
        
        return self.cnt

```

How to build an autonomous car from the scratch :)


> Abstract: This article presents the architecture of Junior, a robotic vehicle capable of navigating
urban environments autonomously. In doing so, the vehicle is able to select
its own routes, perceive and interact with other traffic, and execute various urban
driving skills including lane changes, U-turns, parking, and merging into moving
traffic. The vehicle successfully finished and won second place in the DARPA Urban
Challenge, a robot competition organized by the U.S. Government.
