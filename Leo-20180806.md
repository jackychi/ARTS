## 1. Leetcode

[Check if a binary tree is balanced](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/description/)

> Balanced Binary Tree: a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

#### Analysis
The problem is harder than it appears even it's marked as easy on Leetcode.

The brute-force way would be getting the depths of the left and right subtrees for each node. (see [LeetCode 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)) The time would be O(n<sup>2</sup>) cause for each node, it takes O(n) to check the depth.

Since there are lots of overlaps of the subproblems, dynamic programming could be used here. For example, the heights of the smaller subtrees can be used to built up the heights of the larger subtrees.(TODO: implement this)

Below is a solution that tackles the problem in a post-traversal way.

#### Implementation
```Python
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def helper(root):
            if not root:
                return 0

            lh = helper(root.left)
            if lh == -1:
                return -1

            rh = helper(root.right)
            if rh == -1:
                return -1

            if abs(lh - rh) > 1:
                return -1

            return 1 + max(lh, rh)

        res = helper(root)

        return res != -1
```
