最近在学习郝林老师的 Go 语言专栏，自己也在从 PHP 向 Golang 的转型中，学习了 GOPATH 的概念之后发现有些懵逼

去 go 的官网上找到了一篇[文章](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)

尝试自己进行翻译，努力前行。

### Introduction
This document demonstrates the development of a simple Go package and introduces the `go tool`, the standard way to fetch, build, and install Go packages and commands.

这篇文档演示了一个简单的 Go 代码包的开发，并且介绍了一种获取，创建和安装 Go 代码包和命令行的安装方法，Go Tool。

The go tool requires you to organize your code in a specific way. Please read this document carefully. It explains the simplest way to get up and running with your Go installation.

Go Tool 需要你使用一种特定的方式去写代码，请仔细阅读本文档，你将看到如何使用一种最简单的方式去安装和运行你的 Go 程序。

A similar explanation is available as a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCsL89YtqCs).

### Code organization
#### Overview
- Go programmers typically keep all their Go code in a single workspace.
- Go 编程者通常会把他们所有的 Go 代码放在一个单独的工作区中。
- A workspace contains many version control repositories (managed by Git, for example).
- 一个工作区可以包含多个版本控制仓库（像 Git 这种）
- Each repository contains one or more packages.
- 每一个仓库都包含一个或者多个代码包。
- Each package consists of one or more Go source files in a single directory.
- 每个代码包都有一个目录中的一个或多个 Go 的源代码文件构成。
- The path to a package's directory determines its import path.
- 包的路径决定了导入路径
Note that this differs from other programming environments in which every project has a separate workspace and workspaces are closely tied to version control repositories.

值得注意的是，这和其他的编程语言有很大的不同，其他的变成语言都是每个项目都有一个单独的工作区，而且每个工作区都和版本控制仓库紧密相关。

#### Workspaces
A workspace is a directory hierarchy with two directories at its root:
一个工作区包含两个子目录

- src contains Go source files, and 
- src 目录包括 Go 的源代码文件
- bin contains executable commands.
- `bin` 目录包含可执行文件
The go tool builds and installs binaries to the bin directory.
Go Tool 构建二进制文件并且将其安装到 `bin` 目录下

The src subdirectory typically contains multiple version control repositories (such as for Git or Mercurial) that track the development of one or more source packages.
src 子目录中通常包含多个版本控制仓库（例如 Git 和 Mercurial ），用于跟踪一个或者多个代码包的开发。

To give you an idea of how a workspace looks in practice, here's an example:
为了让你对工作区有一个直观的感受，可以参考下面的例子

```bash
bin/
    hello                          # command executable
    outyet                         # command executable
src/
    github.com/golang/example/
        .git/                      # Git repository metadata
    hello/
        hello.go               # command source
    outyet/
        main.go                # command source
        main_test.go           # test source
    stringutil/
        reverse.go             # package source
        reverse_test.go        # test source
    golang.org/x/image/
        .git/                      # Git repository metadata
    bmp/
        reader.go              # package source
        writer.go              # package source
    ... (many more repositories and packages omitted) ...
```

The tree above shows a workspace containing two repositories (example and image). The example repository contains two commands (hello and outyet) and one library (stringutil). The image repository contains the bmp package and several others.
上面的树形目录展示了一个工作区中包含了两个 Git 仓库（example 和 image），示例中的仓库中包含了两个命令（hello 和 outyet）以及一个函数库（stringutil），image 的库还包括了 bmp 包和一些其他的代码包。

A typical workspace contains many source repositories containing many packages and commands. Most Go programmers keep all their Go source code and dependencies in a single workspace.
一个典型的工作区包括一些源代码库，这些代码库也包含了很多代码包和命令。大部分 Go 程序员习惯把 Go 的源代码和依赖文件放在一个工作区中。

Note that symbolic links should not be used to link files or directories into your workspace.
值得注意的是，不能将软链接链接文件或者目录到工作区中

Commands and libraries are built from different kinds of source packages. We will discuss the distinction later.
命令和库是从不同的源码包构建的，我们会在后续的内容中进行讨论。

#### The GOPATH environment variable
The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. It defaults to a directory named go inside your home directory, so $HOME/go on Unix, $home/go on Plan 9, and %USERPROFILE%go (usually C:UsersYourNamego) on Windows.
GOPATH  环境变量指定了你的工作区位置，默认是在你的 home 目录下，在 Linux 系统中是 $HOME/go或者 $home/go，而在 Windows 中是 %USERPROFILE%go (通常是 C:UsersYourNamego)

If you would like to work in a different location, you will need to set GOPATH to the path to that directory. (Another common setup is to set GOPATH=$HOME.) Note that GOPATH must not be the same path as your Go installation.
如果你想要设置一个不同的工作区，你需要在将 GOPATH 设置成该目录的路径，（通常会把他设置成GOPATH=$HOME ）请注意，GOPATH 不能与 Go 安装的路径相同。

The command go env GOPATH prints the effective current GOPATH; it prints the default location if the environment variable is unset.
运行命令 go env GOPATH 打印当前设置的 GOPATH ; 如果未设置环境变量，它将打印默认位置。

For convenience, add the workspace's bin subdirectory to your PATH:
为了方便，通常会把工作区的 bin 目录添加到环境变量中设置为 GOBIN

```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
The scripts in the rest of this document use $GOPATH instead of $(go env GOPATH) for brevity. To make the scripts run as written if you have not set GOPATH, you can substitute $HOME/go in those commands or else run:
上面的脚本

$ export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
To learn more about the GOPATH environment variable, see 'go help gopath'.

To use a custom workspace location, set the GOPATH environment variable.

Import paths
An import path is a string that uniquely identifies a package. A package's import path corresponds to its location inside a workspace or in a remote repository (explained below).

The packages from the standard library are given short import paths such as "fmt" and "net/http". For your own packages, you must choose a base path that is unlikely to collide with future additions to the standard library or other external libraries.

If you keep your code in a source repository somewhere, then you should use the root of that source repository as your base path. For instance, if you have a GitHub account at github.com/user, that should be your base path.

Note that you don't need to publish your code to a remote repository before you can build it. It's just a good habit to organize your code as if you will publish it someday. In practice you can choose any arbitrary path name, as long as it is unique to the standard library and greater Go ecosystem.

We'll use github.com/user as our base path. Create a directory inside your workspace in which to keep source code:

$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/user
Your first program
To compile and run a simple program, first choose a package path (we'll use github.com/user/hello) and create a corresponding package directory inside your workspace:

$ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/hello
Next, create a file named hello.go inside that directory, containing the following Go code.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() 
fmt.Println("Hello, world.")
}
Now you can build and install that program with the go tool:

$ go install github.com/user/hello
Note that you can run this command from anywhere on your system. The go tool finds the source code by looking for the github.com/user/hello package inside the workspace specified by GOPATH.

You can also omit the package path if you run go install from the package directory:

$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/hello
$ go install
This command builds the hello command, producing an executable binary. It then installs that binary to the workspace's bin directory as hello (or, under Windows, hello.exe). In our example, that will be $GOPATH/bin/hello, which is $HOME/go/bin/hello.

The go tool will only print output when an error occurs, so if these commands produce no output they have executed successfully.

You can now run the program by typing its full path at the command line:

$ $GOPATH/bin/hello
Hello, world.
Or, as you have added $GOPATH/bin to your PATH, just type the binary name:

$ hello
Hello, world.
If you're using a source control system, now would be a good time to initialize a repository, add the files, and commit your first change. Again, this step is optional: you do not need to use source control to write Go code.

$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/hello
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/user/work/src/github.com/user/hello/.git/
$ git add hello.go
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
[master (root-commit) 0b4507d](#) initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  create mode 100644 hello.go
Pushing the code to a remote repository is left as an exercise for the reader.

Your first library
Let's write a library and use it from the hello program.

Again, the first step is to choose a package path (we'll use github.com/user/stringutil) and create the package directory:

$ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/stringutil
Next, create a file named reverse.go in that directory with the following contents.

// Package stringutil contains utility functions for working with strings.
package stringutil

// Reverse returns its argument string reversed rune-wise left to right.
func Reverse(s string) string 
r := [](#)rune(s)
for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i \< len(r)/2; i, j = i+1, j-1 
r[i](#), r[j](#) = r[j](#), r[i](#)
}
return string(r)
}
Now, test that the package compiles with go build:

$ go build github.com/user/stringutil
Or, if you are working in the package's source directory, just:

$ go build
This won't produce an output file. Instead it saves the compiled package in the local build cache.

After confirming that the stringutil package builds, modify your original hello.go (which is in $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/hello) to use it:

package main

import (
"fmt"

"github.com/user/stringutil"
)

func main() 
fmt.Println(stringutil.Reverse("!oG ,olleH"))
}
Install the hello program:

$ go install github.com/user/hello
Running the new version of the program, you should see a new, reversed message:

$ hello
Hello, Go!
After the steps above, your workspace should look like this:

bin/
hello                 # command executable
src/
github.com/user/
hello/
hello.go      # command source
stringutil/
reverse.go    # package source
Package names
The first statement in a Go source file must be

package name
where name is the package's default name for imports. (All files in a package must use the same name.)

Go's convention is that the package name is the last element of the import path: the package imported as "crypto/rot13" should be named rot13.

Executable commands must always use package main.

There is no requirement that package names be unique across all packages linked into a single binary, only that the import paths (their full file names) be unique.

See Effective Go to learn more about Go's naming conventions.

Testing
Go has a lightweight test framework composed of the go test command and the testing package.

You write a test by creating a file with a name ending in test.go that contains functions named TestXXX with signature `func (t *testing.T)`. The test framework runs each such function; if the function calls a failure function such as t.Error or t.Fail, the test is considered to have failed.

Add a test to the stringutil package by creating the file $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/stringutil/reverse_test.go containing the following Go code.
```
package stringutil

import "testing"

func TestReverse(t *testing.T) 
cases := [](#)struct 
in, want string
}
"Hello, world", "dlrow ,olleH",
"Hello, 世界", "界世 ,olleH",
"", "",
}
for _, c := range cases 
got := Reverse(c.in)
if got != c.want 
t.Errorf("Reverse(%q) == %q, want %q", c.in, got, c.want)
}
}
}
```
Then run the test with go test:

$ go test github.com/user/stringutil
ok      github.com/user/stringutil 0.165s
As always, if you are running the go tool from the package directory, you can omit the package path:

$ go test
ok      github.com/user/stringutil 0.165s
Run go help test and see the testing package documentation for more detail.

Remote packages
An import path can describe how to obtain the package source code using a revision control system such as Git or Mercurial. The go tool uses this property to automatically fetch packages from remote repositories. For instance, the examples described in this document are also kept in a Git repository hosted at GitHub github.com/golang/example. If you include the repository URL in the package's import path, go get will fetch, build, and install it automatically:

$ go get github.com/golang/example/hello
$ $GOPATH/bin/hello
Hello, Go examples!
If the specified package is not present in a workspace, go get will place it inside the first workspace specified by GOPATH. (If the package does already exist, go get skips the remote fetch and behaves the same as go install.)

After issuing the above go get command, the workspace directory tree should now look like this:

bin/
hello                           # command executable
src/
github.com/golang/example/
.git/                       # Git repository metadata
hello/
hello.go                # command source
stringutil/
reverse.go              # package source
reverse_test.go         # test source
github.com/user/
hello/
hello.go                # command source
stringutil/
reverse.go              # package source
reverse_test.go         # test source
The hello command hosted at GitHub depends on the stringutil package within the same repository. The imports in hello.go file use the same import path convention, so the go get command is able to locate and install the dependent package, too.

import "github.com/golang/example/stringutil"
This convention is the easiest way to make your Go packages available for others to use. The Go Wiki and godoc.org provide lists of external Go projects.

For more information on using remote repositories with the go tool, see go help importpath.
