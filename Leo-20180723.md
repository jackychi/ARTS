## 1. Leetcode
 [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/description/): iterative

#### Analysis
It's trivial to solve the problem recursively, but to do it iteratively is not simple.
TODO: explain why it's not simple

#### Implementation
```Python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        s = []
        curr = root
        while curr or s:
            # Add all left nodes
            while curr:
                s.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            # Pop up a node to check
            curr = s.pop()
            # Add right node
            res.append(curr.val)
            curr = curr.right

        return res
```
## 2. Article and comment
[What is tail recursion?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33923/what-is-tail-recursion) from stackoverflow.com

> In traditional recursion, the typical model is that you perform your recursive calls first, and then you take the return value of the recursive call and calculate the result. In this manner, you don't get the result of your calculation until you have returned from every recursive call.

> In tail recursion, you perform your calculations first, and then you execute the recursive call, passing the results of your current step to the next recursive step. This results in the last statement being in the form of "(return (recursive-function params))" (I think that's the syntax for Lisp). Basically, the return value of any given recursive step is the same as the return value of the next recursive call."

#### Example

sum(x): sum 1 to x, inclusive (excerpt from the original post)

**non-tail recursive (JavaScript) implementation**

```JavaScript
function recsum(x) {
    if (x===1) {
        return x;
    } else {
        return x + recsum(x-1);
    }
}
```
If you called recsum(5), this is what the JavaScript interpreter would evaluate:
```
recsum(5)
5 + recsum(4)
5 + (4 + recsum(3))
5 + (4 + (3 + recsum(2)))
5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + recsum(1))))
5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + 1)))
15
```
Note how every recursive call has to complete before the JavaScript interpreter begins to actually do the work of calculating the sum.

** tail recursive implementation **
```JavaScript
function tailrecsum(x, running_total=0) {
    if (x===0) {
        return running_total;
    } else {
        return tailrecsum(x-1, running_total+x);
    }
}
```
Here's the sequence of events that would occur if you called tailrecsum(5), (which would effectively be tailrecsum(5, 0), because of the default second argument).
```
tailrecsum(5, 0)
tailrecsum(4, 5)
tailrecsum(3, 9)
tailrecsum(2, 12)
tailrecsum(1, 14)
tailrecsum(0, 15)
15
```
In the tail-recursive case, with each evaluation of the recursive call, the running_total is updated.
