## 1. Leetcode
[Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/)

> Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
```
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]

```

#### Analysis
Brute force would cost O(N<sup>2</sup>). A better way would be sorting the longer list, and binary search the unique items
of the short list in the sorted list. 

Time: NlogM, where M is the length of the longer list, N is the unique items in the shorter list.

Python has a [`bisect` module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html) implementing the binary search algorithm. However, it doesn't have a method checking 
the existence of a particular value. Some workaround is needed.

#### Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums1, nums2):
        """
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        M, N = len(nums1), len(nums2)
        if M < N:
            return self.intersection(nums2, nums1)
        
        nums1.sort()
        ans = []
        for num in set(nums2):
            i = bisect.bisect_left(nums1, num)
            if i != M and nums1[i] == num:
                ans.append(num)
                
        return ans
        
```

## 2. Article and comment
[pygtrie](https://github.com/google/pygtrie): a Python library implementing a [trie data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) offered by Google.

So far [Python hasn't provided a standard library for any tree-kind data structures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), e.g. there is no Java's [TreeMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html) equivalent in Python.

> Trie data structure, also known as radix or prefix tree, is a tree associating keys to values where all the descendants of a node have a common prefix (associated with that node).

> The trie module contains Trie, CharTrie and StringTrie classes each implementing a mutable mapping interface, i.e. dict interface. As such, in most circumstances, Trie could be used as a drop-in replacement for a dict, but **the prefix nature of the data structure is trie’s real strength**.

[pygtrie](https://github.com/google/pygtrie)

Features

- A full mutable mapping implementation.
- Supports iterating over as well as deleting a subtrie.
- Supports prefix checking as well as shortest and longest prefix
  look-up.
- Extensible for any kind of user-defined keys.
- A PrefixSet supports “all keys starting with given prefix” logic.
- Can store any value including None.
