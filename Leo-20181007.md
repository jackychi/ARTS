[Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5

Example 2:

Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4

#### Analysis
- Brute force: return Kth element of the sorted array, time: O(nlogn) - depending on the sorting algorithm
- Better way: maintain a minheap with size K, push element to the heap if it's greater than current mininum of the heap. 
The root of the heaq would be the Kth element. time: O(nlogK) - maintaining invariance of a heap needs O(logK)
#### Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # maintain a min-heap with size k, hq[0] is the min of k elements
        hq = nums[:k]
        heapq.heapify(hq)
        
        # push num in if num > current min
        # after the iteration, all non-root nums >= hq[0]
        # hq[0] would be the Kth largest element
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > hq[0]:
                heapq.heappushpop(hq, nums[i])
        return hq[0]
```
