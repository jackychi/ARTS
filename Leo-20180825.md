key messages:
1. SSH is working with application layer and used for replacing insecure apps such as telnet
2. SSL/TLS is implemented at the top of transportation layer. It uses Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) which is computational intensive due to the overhead.
 It runs on top of TCP only. HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS. 
     > [A public key infrastructure (PKI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure#Methods_of_certification) is a system for the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity.
3. IPSec runs at the networking layer. It doesn't rely on PKI and used mostly for larger corporations, e.g. IPSec VPN. It can secure TCP, UDP and SCTP
