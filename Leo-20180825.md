## 1. Leetcode
[Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/)
> Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

> Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
Explanation: 

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
 ```
#### Analysis
The brute force solution is simple and straightforward: for each sliding window, get the max
value with max() method. The time would be O(Nk).

However, there are lots of redundant computation in above approach: by sliding the window, only the tail
and the head of the window are changed, thus the max value of the previous window (prev_max) already says a lot of things about the 
current window (curr_max): **prev_max could potentially be the curr_max, as long as it's greater than the new member and is still in the window**. In the case where prev_max is gone,
we need to find a new max in current window.  The question is how to perserve such information.

Since we want to know when prev_max is moving out of the window, we can store the index of the max value. 
Also, we want to find the next max value if prev_max is out, we can store all the indices of all candidates - in 
certain order. That's where a deque, or "double ended queue", shines - new candidates keep coming on one end while old max gets popped out
on the other end. 


#### Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        dq = collections.deque()
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # clean dq before add i
            while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < num:
                dq.pop()
            dq.append(i) 
            
            # remove the max_id when it's out of window
            # next item would be the new max_id
            if i - dq[0] == k:
                dq.popleft()
            
            if i >= k - 1:
                res.append(nums[dq[0]])
                
        return res
```

key messages:
1. SSH is working with application layer and used for replacing insecure apps such as telnet
2. SSL/TLS is implemented at the top of transportation layer. It uses Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) which is computational intensive due to the overhead.
 It runs on top of TCP only. HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS. 
     > [A public key infrastructure (PKI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure#Methods_of_certification) is a system for the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity.
3. IPSec runs at the networking layer. It doesn't rely on PKI and used mostly for larger corporations, e.g. IPSec VPN. It can secure TCP, UDP and SCTP
