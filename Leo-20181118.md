## 1. Leetcode
[Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)

> Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

#### Analysis
There is [`random.choices()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) method for such task Since Python 3.6. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/random.py).

The algorithm is like:
- getting the accumulated weights,
- randomly picking up a number that <= max(accumulated weights),
- finding the insertion index for the random number in the list of the accumulated weights, say `i`, 
- returning `population[i]`. For this question, we can just return `i`.

Usually, a binary search([`bisec`](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/bisect.html)) is used to find the insertion index, which costs O(logN).

Btw, numpy also provides a similar method: [numpy.random.choice](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html).
#### Implementation
```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, w):
        """
        :type w: List[int]
        """
        from itertools import accumulate
        self.cumdist = list(accumulate(w))
        
        

    def pickIndex(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        r = random.random() * self.cumdist[-1]
        return bisect.bisect(self.cumdist, r)


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
```

## 2. Article and comment
[Python 3 Random Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)

> Almost all module functions depend on the basic function `random()`, which generates a random float uniformly 
in the semi-open range `[0.0, 1.0)`. Python uses the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) as the core generator. 
It produces 53-bit precision floats and has a period of 2**19937-1. The underlying implementation in C is both fast and threadsafe.

#### Functions for integers
- random.randrange(stop)
- random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
- random.randint(a, b), Return a random integer N such that `a <= N <= b`

#### Functions for sequences
- random.choice(seq)
- random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)
- random.shuffle(x[, random]), Shuffle the sequence x in place.
- random.sample(population, k), Return a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence or set. Used for random sampling **without replacement**.

#### Real-valued distributions
- random.random(), Return the next random floating point number in the range [0.0, 1.0).
- random.uniform(a, b)
- random.gauss(mu, sigma)
- random.normalvariate(mu, sigma)
