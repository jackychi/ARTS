## 1. Leetcode
[Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/description/)
> There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.

> Example 1:
```

Input:
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]

Output: "wertf"
 ```
 
#### Analysis
There are two parts involved in order to solve the problem: 1. understand the input, e.g. `wrt` is before
`wrf` means `t` is before `f` for the aliens. 2. build a graph and sort the graph topologically.  

#### Implementation
```python
class Solution(object):
    def alienOrder(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        from collections import defaultdict, deque
        def build_G():
            G = defaultdict(set)
            for i in range(len(words) - 1):
                w1, w2 = words[i], words[i+1]
                for j in range(min(len(w1), len(w2))):
                        if w1[j] != w2[j]:
                            G[w1[j]].add(w2[j])
                            break
            return G
        
        G = build_G()
        visiting, done = set(), deque()
        def DFS(ch):
            if ch in done:
                return True
            if ch in visiting:
                return False
            visiting.add(ch)
            for child in G.get(ch, []):
                if not DFS(child):
                    return False
            done.appendleft(ch)
            return True
        
        # topological sort G  
        for ch in G:
            if ch not in visiting:
                if not DFS(ch):
                    return ""
                
        all_chs = set([ch for word in words for ch in word])
        return "".join(list(done) + [ch for ch in all_chs if ch not in done])
```

[Google Developer: Inside look at modern web browser (part 1)](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/inside-browser-part1)

It's the 1st part of a 4-part blog that explains the details of Chrome's architecture.

Highlights:
1. Generally two architectures for browser: many threads in a big process(left) or multi-processes with a few threads(right) in each process. Chrome adopts a multi-process architecture: Browser process, Renderer process, Network process, Plugin process, etc

![chrom's multi-process arch](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part1/browser-arch.png)

2. For each tab, render processes, along with many other processes, are created and assigned to each tab.
![processes for each tab](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/images/inside-browser/part1/browserui.png)

3. Pros and cons of multi-process arch
    a. pros: 1) one dead tab won't impact other tabs, 2) security and sandboxing
    b. cons:  may use too much memo resource if too many processes been created. Each process often contains copies
    of common infrastructure. "This means more memory usage as they can't be shared the way they would be if 
    they were threads inside the same process."

4. Servicification
    To save memory, Chrome is making architecture changes to run each part of the browser program as a service allowing
    to easily split into different processes or aggregate into one. In powerful hardware, Chrome may split each service into
    different processes. Otherwise, it consolidates services into one process saving memory.

5. Site isolation is enabled on desktop by default since Chrome 67. Each cross-site iframe in a tab gets a separate rendered process.
