## 1. Leetcode

[Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)

> Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

> Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
> After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

#### Analysis
The key is to locate the node to be deleted. Cause it's a singly linked list, the obvious way would be traversing the list to get the length (say N) and traversing N-n steps to reach the target node.

It would be more challenging and interesting to do it in ONE pass. The idea is to use two iterators(say A and B), one ahead of the other.
First A moves n steps, then A and B move in parallel. Once A reaches the end of the list (that's N - n steps), B just reaches the node that needs to be removed.

#### Code

```Python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        first_iter = head
        for _ in range(n):
            first_iter = first_iter.next

        # use a dummy_head to handle the corner case, e.g. head to be removed
        dummy_head = ListNode(0)
        dummy_head.next = head
        second_iter = dummy_head
        while first_iter:
            first_iter, second_iter = first_iter.next, second_iter.next

        # second_iter.next is the node to be deleted
        second_iter.next = second_iter.next.next

        return dummy_head.next
```

[Calculating Password Complexity](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/article/Calculating-Password-Complexity)

The article explains the importance of password complexity. As the computer is getting more powerful and botnet is rising, cracking a password is becoming more easily than ever. For example, " To break a password such as "%ZBGbv]8", it would take (1.7*10^-6 * 80^8) seconds / 2, or 45.2 years. On a supercomputer or botnet, this will take 4 hours."

[Command for determining public IP](https://askubuntu.com/questions/95910/command-for-determining-my-public-ip)

As stated in the original question, it's easy to just google w/o using any command, but if there are hundred of servers to check, it would be handy to do it using command.

The basic idea is using some third-party DNS service with `dig` command. Of course, the third-party service should be reliable and trustworthy. For example, using dig with OpenDNS as resolver:
```
$ dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com

111.222.333.444
```

TODO: Check the limitation of `dig` and external DNS service
